      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Welcome! By using this app, you agree to embark on a whimsical journey through the land of temporary abodes. {"Let's"} set some ground rules that are as flexible as a rubber chicken but as binding as a friendship bracelet:
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
        <span className="font-bold text-lg">1.</span> Thou shalt not hog all the hot water. We believe in equality, especially in the bathroom. Share the warmth!
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
      <span className="font-bold text-lg">2.</span> In case of a zombie apocalypse, please ensure that the emergency exit is zombie-proof. We cannot be held responsible for supernatural inconveniences.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
      <span className="font-bold text-lg">3.</span> If you discover a portal to another dimension in the closet, kindly inform us. Extra-dimensional beings are not eligible for our Superhost program.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
      <span className="font-bold text-lg">4.</span> Pillow fights are strongly encouraged, but participants must sign a waiver acknowledging the fluffiness risks involved.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
      <span className="font-bold text-lg">5.</span> All guests are required to showcase their weirdest talent during check-in. Bonus points for juggling flamingos or reciting Shakespeare backwards.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
        By continuing to use this app, you pledge to bring joy, laughter, and a sense of adventure to every doorstep you temporarily call home. Failure to comply may result in spontaneous dance parties led by our mascot, Sir Quirks-A-Lot.
